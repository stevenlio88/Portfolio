I am Cantonese, born in [**Hong Kong, China**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hong+Kong/@22.3523907,113.8097704,10z) and grew up in [**Macau, China**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Macau,+Macao/@22.1981955,113.5249235). I moved to **Canada** in 2007 and now living in **Toronto, Ontario**.

I hold an **M.Sc. in Data Science** from the **University of British Columbia** and a **B.Sc. in Statistics** from **McMaster University**. 

I have **over six years of professional experience** specialized in designing efficient data workflows and **extracting actionable 
insights** to support cross-functional teams in strategic decision-making in **Government, Telecom / Retail and Software industries**. Proficient in **Python** and **R**, I excel at creating 
data pipelines, feature engineering, data visualization applications and implementing advanced algorithms to **enhance machine learning workflows**. 

My expertise extends to writing complex **SQL** queries for **processing and aggregating large datasets**, and **designing 
data ETL processes**. I am also experienced in applying machine learning algorithms for a variety of tasks, including classification, clustering, 
statistical inference, regression modeling, time series modeling, and A/B testing to support analytics. 
I have also **developed advanced machine learning models** such as **implementing and training neural networks (CNN)** for **image classification, segmentation, computer vision** tasks. 

My advanced data analytics have supported marketing strategy research in areas such as **Predicting Customer Value**, 
**Customer Segmentation**, **Sentiment Analysis**, **Market Potential and Shares Estimation**, and **Competitor Analysis**. 

I have a keen eye for spotting details in data and building the best solution to extract actionable insights from complex data, support business decision-making.

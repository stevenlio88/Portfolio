First time doing this, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes!\nDisplay some of my favorite Math equations: #Einstein\u0026rsquo;s famous Mass-energy equivalence formula üåå:\n$$ E = mc^2 $$\nFrom wiki: The formula defines the energy E of a particle in its rest frame as the product of mass m with the speed of light squared (c¬≤).\nThe üîî Curve: With the probability density function:\n$$ f(x | Œº, œÉ^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(x - Œº)^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) $$\nWhere Œº is the mean or expectation of the distribution and œÉ is the standard deviation. i.e. variance of œÉ¬≤. It is also known as the Gaussian Distribution or more commonly known as the Normal Distribution.

Given a data vector with n samples and p parameters:\n$$ \\begin{Bmatrix} y_i, x_{i1},\\cdot \\cdot \\cdot ,x_{ip} \\end{Bmatrix}^{n}_{i=1} $$\nWhere the dependent variable y and the p-size vector of regressors x are assumed to be a linear relationship. Where the error variable Œµ was modeled such that it is the minimum and ideally it experiences an unobserved random variable. i.e. \u0026ldquo;noise\u0026rdquo;.\nThen ideally we want to find Œ≤ where the model has the form:\n$$ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot + \\beta_p x_{ip} + \\varepsilon_i = x^T \\beta + \\varepsilon $$\nOr simply\n$$ y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon $$\nWhere\n$$ y = \\begin{Bmatrix} y_1, \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot y_n \\end{Bmatrix}^T $$\n$$ X = \\begin{pmatrix} x^T_1 \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ x^T_n \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; x_{11} \u0026amp; \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \u0026amp; x_{1p} \\\\\\ \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\cdot \u0026amp; \\\\\\ \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\cdot \u0026amp; \\\\\\ \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\cdot \u0026amp; \\\\\\ 1 \u0026amp; x_{n1} \u0026amp; \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \u0026amp; x_{np} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nand\n$$ \\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix} , \\varepsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ \\cdot \\\\\\ \\varepsilon_n \\end{pmatrix} $$\nHence for a line, you are solving for the equation with one parameter $$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$$ and for a plane there will be two parameters. $$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2$$\nLeast-squares estimation (a.k.a. Line of best fit): #Since y and x are assumed to be a linear relationship and we would like to find the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; Œ≤ which solve the system of equations and to minimize Œµ. Hence let: $$ \\varepsilon = L(X,y,\\hat{\\beta})=\\left | X\\hat{\\beta}-y \\right |^2 = (X\\hat{\\beta} - y)^T(X\\hat{\\beta}-y) \\ $$ $$ = y^Ty - y^TX\\hat{\\beta} - \\hat{\\beta}^TX^Ty + \\hat{\\beta}^TX^TX\\hat{\\beta} $$ Where L is called the Loss function, essentially the error term is modeled with the input X, y, Œ≤. Since X, y is the original data we want to \u0026ldquo;fit\u0026rdquo;, therefore we can find the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; Œ≤ at which L(X, y, Œ≤) is minimized.\nHence the first derivative of L(X, y, Œ≤):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L(X,y,\\hat{\\beta})}{\\partial \\hat{\\beta}} = -2X^Ty+2X^TX\\hat{\\beta} $$\nSince X, y is fixed and known and we only interested in the \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; Œ≤ therefore:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty $$\nThis is the case for the Simple Linear Regression.\nThis concludes the Hello World! üåé Thank you for reading!\n","date":"24 Jun, 2024","permalink":"/blog/hello_world/","section":"Blog","summary":"Hello internet, welcome to my personal website üê£!","title":"Hello World! üåé"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/machine-learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Machine Learning"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/math/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Math"},{"content":"Interesting projects I\u0026rsquo;ve done in the past.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"Interesting projects I\u0026rsquo;ve done in the past.","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/python/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Python"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/r/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"R"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"\rA picture of me\rI am Cantonese, born in Hong Kong, China and grew up in Macau, China.

Hi! ä½ å¥½! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Steven Lio. I was born in [**Hong Kong, China**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hong+Kong/@22.3523907,113.8097704,10z) and grew up in [**Macau, China**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Macau,+Macao/@22.1981955,113.5249235). 
I moved to **Canada** in 2007 and currently living in **Toronto, Ontario**.

I received my **Master of Data Science** from [**University of British Columbia (Canada)**](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) and my **Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics** from [**McMaster University (Canada)**](https://scce.science.mcmaster.ca/). 

With **over 6 years of professional experience**, I specialized in developing data-driven solutions and workflows to **extract actionable 
insights** that support strategic decision-making for cross-functional teams in **Government, Telecom, Retail and Software industries**. 
I possess a natural curiousity and a keen eye for detail when analyzing data, enabling me to find the optimal solutions for finding data-driven solutions and drive business decisions.

Proficient in **Python** and **R**, I excel in creating end-to-end machine learning workflows for data science projects. 
My expertise includes developing **efficient data pipelines**, conducting **feature engineering**, **implementing machine learning models** and **building interactive visualization applications**. Like this one [here](https://stevenlio.shinyapps.io/polyfit/).

I have practical experience tackling real-world challenges by applying machine learning algorithms for a variety of tasks. These include **classification, clustering, 
statistical inference, regression modeling, time series modeling**, all aimed at enhancing analytical insights and decision-making process. 
I have also developed advanced machine learning models such as **implementing and training neural networks (CNN)** for **image classification, segmentation, computer vision** tasks. 
My expertise extends to writing complex **SQL** queries for **processing and aggregating large datasets**, and **designing robust data ETL processes**. 

My advanced data analytics have supported marketing strategy research in areas such as **Predicting Customer Value**, **Customer Segmentation**, **Sentiment Analysis**, 
**Market Potential and Shares Estimation**, **Competitor Analysis**, **Optimizing Sales Channels**.

### Something else about me

On my free time, I enjoyed roaming in the nature and photography. I loves animals and I have a [cat](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8I2xdausgC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) named "HÇ”HÇ”" (Tiger in Mandarin Chinese).
I also play the piano and guitar. My favourites composers are [Chopin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin) and [Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven).

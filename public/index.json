I moved to Canada in 2007 and now living in Toronto, Ontario.\nI hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from the University of British Columbia and a B.Sc. in Statistics from McMaster University.\nI have over six years of professional experience specialized in designing efficient data workflows and extracting actionable insights to support cross-functional teams in strategic decision-making in Government, Telecom / Retail and Software industries. Proficient in Python and R, I excel at creating data pipelines, feature engineering, data visualization applications and implementing advanced algorithms to enhance machine learning workflows.\nMy expertise extends to writing complex SQL queries for processing and aggregating large datasets, and designing data ETL processes. I am also experienced in applying machine learning algorithms for a variety of tasks, including classification, clustering, statistical inference, regression modeling, time series modeling, and A/B testing to support analytics. I have also developed advanced machine learning models such as implementing and training neural networks (CNN) for image classification, segmentation, computer vision tasks.\nMy advanced data analytics have supported marketing strategy research in areas such as Predicting Customer Value, Customer Segmentation, Sentiment Analysis, Market Potential and Shares Estimation, and Competitor Analysis.\nI have a keen eye for spotting details in data and building the best solution to extract actionable insights from complex data, support business decision-making.\nSomething else about me #On my free time, I enjoyed the nature and photography. I loves animals and I have a cat named \u0026ldquo;HÇ”HÇ”\u0026rdquo; (Tiger in Mandarin Chinese). I also play the piano and guitar. My favourites composers are forever Chopin and Beethoven.\nIf you are interested to learn more about me, feel free to message me on Linkedin, or follow me on Instagram.\nFavourite quotes: #\u0026ldquo;MEOW~\u0026rdquo; - HuHu\n\u0026ldquo;All models are wrong, but some are useful\u0026rdquo; - George Box\n\u0026ldquo;We are the representatives of the cosmos; we are an example of what hydrogen atoms can do, given 15 billion years of cosmic evolution.\u0026rdquo; - Carl Sagan\n","date":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"A picture of me\rI am Cantonese, born in Hong Kong, China and grew up in Macau, China.","title":"About me"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Detailed RÃ©sumÃ© can be found here.\nTechnical Skills # Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL C#, VB.NET, .Net Development Machine Learning Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn pandas, numpy OpenCV, Pillow Data Visualization: Dash, Shiny Plotly, Vega-Altair, matplotlib, ggplot Tableau, PowerBI Software Development: Git, Github, Jira, Jenkins, Docker PowerShell, bash Other tools: Microsoft SQL Server, Visual Studio ArcGIS, QGIS SAS EG, MATLAB, MicroStrategy Power Automate Desktop, UiPath, Automation 360, BluePrism Analytics topics: Marketing Strategy Analytics, Customer Value Prediction, Segmentation, Sentiment Analysis, Market Potential and Shares Estimation, Competitor Analysis, Pre \u0026amp; Post Campaign Analysis Professional Experience #Data Scientist #Blueprint Software System - Toronto, ON\nSep, 2022 â€“ Jun, 2024\nDeveloped tailored backend solutions using .NET framework and C#, optimizing SQL queries and data architecture for scalability and robustness.
